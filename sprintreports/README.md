Sprint 4 Progress Report
===================

### What progress have you made this Sprint and what did it entail?
Have an Alpha Prototype that has a basic calendar, user authentication, Tenting101 feature, FAQ, and the When2Meet front-end completed. 

### Links to artifacts (preferably public) that show evidence of your work this Sprint
In the GTHC repository is a link to the Bluebull Webapp portion where each branch is separated into different components of the app. Please take a look at each branch of our repository. 

### What were the hardest parts of what you did this Sprint (and why)?
Integrating code in terms of how the front-end will meet the back-end was hard to plan. 

### What were the most important things you learned this Sprint?
Learned a lot about how to integrate certain aspects of our users to the design of our dynamic data. Specifically with the When2Meet form, it was important to see that Duke Students schedules work on 75 minute intervals. This helps with scheduling with less boxes on the When2Meet form. Also, people doing night shifts can be consolidated to just one box instead of 7 different times.  

### What do you plan to do next Sprint?
We plan on figuring out how to incoporate this front-end to the back-end, specifically for scheduling purposes. 

### What can you do to be more productive next Sprint?
Next Sprint, we hope to have more productive work sessions where we code hard. We intend to bounce ideas off of each other and continue to work. It is esssential that we do this to stay on track. 

Sprint 3 Progress Report
===================

### What progress have you made this Sprint and what did it entail?
Have a baseline prototype working with more features such as Tenting 101 and dashboard items. 

### Links to artifacts (preferably public) that show evidence of your work this Sprint
Meetings notes can be found in the meeting notes file in the respository. 

### What were the hardest parts of what you did this Sprint (and why)?
Communication. It was communication between team members and setting up times to actually sit down and code was tough. 

### What were the most important things you learned this Sprint?
Testing was an important thing learned in this Sprint and how hard it is to set up User Auth on the mobile end. 

### What do you plan to do next Sprint?
Delegating tasks. We plan on improving our communication with daily standups and sitting down and organizing every task. 

### What can you do to be more productive next Sprint?
Next Sprint, we hope to have productive work sessions where we code hard. We bounce ideas off of each other and continue to work. It is esssential that we do this to stay on track. 


Sprint 2 Progress Report
===================

### What progress have you made this Sprint and what did it entail?
Have a baseline prototype working with User Authentication, Basic Features of the website. 

### Links to artifacts (preferably public) that show evidence of your work this Sprint
Meetings notes can be found in the meeting notes file in the respository. 


### What were the hardest parts of what you did this Sprint (and why)?
Definitely beginning an app and figuring out what exactly the basic layout is was tough. 

### What were the most important things you learned this Sprint?
Communication is key between the group and commitments are hard to work around as everyone has 
tough schedules as CompSci Majors. We have to come together and balance everything that we have
helping each other when the other needs help. 

### What do you plan to do next Sprint?
We plan on improving our communication and bouncing ideas off of each other including helping 
each other if one person is better at something than the other. 

### What can you do to be more productive next Sprint?
Next Sprint, we hope to utilize our time better by directing our attention at meetings to basic
problems we can solve together rather than spending time planning what we will do. Implementation
is key now so we have to focus on that. 

Sprint 1 Progress Report
===================

### What progress have you made this Sprint and what did it entail?
Have a Project Contract, Mockup with basic features to implement.  

### Links to artifacts (preferably public) that show evidence of your work this Sprint
Meetings notes can be found in the meeting notes file in the respository. 

### What were the hardest parts of what you did this Sprint (and why)?
It is tough to visualize something that you have not yet created. It is tough to know
what exactly it should/would look like based upon the information we have so far. 

### What were the most important things you learned this Sprint?
Utilizing AdobeXD is incredibly important towards mockup designs.

### What do you plan to do next Sprint?
Next sprint, we hope to start actually implementing the designs and features we have
laid out. 

### What can you do to be more productive next Sprint?
Next Sprint, we hope to utilize our talents in each area designating each person different 
roles depending on their abilities and skills. 

Sprint 0 Progress Report
===================

### What progress have you made this Sprint and what did it entail?
Discovering our project and what features we want on it. 

### Links to artifacts (preferably public) that show evidence of your work this Sprint
Meetings notes can be found in the meeting notes file in the respository. 

### What were the hardest parts of what you did this Sprint (and why)?
Prioritizing the most important features without going overboard on adding too many features is definitely 
tough. Just finding that fine line where we cannot cross in terms of our limit and ability to finish in time. 

### What were the most important things you learned this Sprint?
Orgnization is key during meetings and figuring out what exactly is the most important aspects/features 
our client and users would want is tough. 

### What do you plan to do next Sprint?
By creating focus groups and people we can bounce ideas off of, it helps us as developers find the best 
features to implement for all users. 

### What can you do to be more productive next Sprint?
Next Sprint, we hope to take the surveys and focus groups and figure out just what will be on this app.
